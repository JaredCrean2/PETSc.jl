# PETSc.jl

PETSc.jl is a julia wrapper for the [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/documentation/manual/) package which allows solving partial differential equations in parallel on laptops or massively parallel high-performance systems.

The use of julia greatly simplifies the code that developers have to write, while allowing to employ julia features such as automatic differentiation. The julia wrapper also comes with a pre-build library, which greatly simplifies the process of getting your first code working (in parallel).
